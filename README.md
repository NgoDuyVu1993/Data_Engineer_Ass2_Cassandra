# Data_Engineer_Ass2_Cassandra
In the assignment, we will use Modeling NoSQL database or Apache Cassandra database </br>
- Design tables to answer the queries outlined in the project template </br>
- Write Apache Cassandra `CREATE KEYSPACE` and `SET KEYSPACE` statements </br>
- Develop your CREATE statement for each of the tables to address each question </br>
- Load the data with `INSERT` statement for each of the tables </br>
- Include `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses in your `CREATE` statements to create tables only if the tables do not already exist. We recommend you also include DROP TABLE statement for each table, this way you can run drop and create tables whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline </br>
- Test by running the proper select statements with the correct `WHERE` clause </br>
